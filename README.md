- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm **@Kovenda Mbuale**, a 2022 MAY **Bachelors in Data Science** graduate from @LutherCollege
-  I recently interned at **@MayoClinic** as **DATA SCIENCE ANALYST**
- üëÄ As a Data Science Analyst, I work with these technologies: **Python, R, SQL, Tableau**, and **Excel**. 
- I have exeprience in **DATA SCIENCE, DATA ENGINEERING** and **DATA ANALYSIS**

**My Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process** using Python, POSTGRESQL, AWS-RDS, and pgAdmin 4:
- üå± I do data EXTRACTION from applications using Python's Request Library to call the applications' REST APIs
-  I Transforam JSON response from the API into a Python's PANDAS DataFrame
-  I then clean the data using python's PANDAS and NumPy Libraries
-  connect to AWS-RDS PostGRESQL database and load the data from the DataFrame into database TABLES in specific SCHEMAS using SQL Wrapped in Python Code
-  I finally automate this process of API call - JSON to pandas.DF - pandas.DF to POSTGRESQL AWS-RDS database by using Python Functions and SQL INSERT and UPDATE querries and wrapping all that into a SCHEDULER

**My Data Analysis Process** using SQL, Tableau, Python and R:
- I first pull and join different Tables from the database using SQL
- I then convert the joined tables into pandas.DFs
- After that I do Data Exploratory Visualizations using Pyhton and R's seaborn, ggplot and Matplot libraries
- I then build **Analytics Dashboards** in **Tableau** and share them on @TableauPublic
- Finally I analyse the data using various Regression Analysis and Machine learning techinques using R and Python libraries 
- And also from time to time build Deep Learning models 

**Currently:** *looking for opportunities in Data Science: Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer or Data Science Product Manager
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm also looking to collaborate on Data Science Projects here on github.
- üì´ If have any questions, suggestions or offers reach out to me: mbuako01@luther.edu | +1 (507) 405-9754
